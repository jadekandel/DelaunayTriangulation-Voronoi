# DelaunayTriangulation-Voronoi

First, for my Intro to Computer Science class, I designed a program that implements user input to produce a Voronoi Partition. While this program started as a school project, I developed the program outside of class during winter break. Then, for my Algorithms final project, my group and I created detailed Delaunay and Voronoi patterns using Boyer-Watson algorithm in O(log n) runtime, a huge improvement from my intro project. Inspired by Voronoi patterns in nature, I proposed these projects.
