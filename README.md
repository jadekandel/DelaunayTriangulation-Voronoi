# DelaunayTriangulation-Voronoi

First, for my Intro to Computer Science class, I designed a program (interactiveVoronoi.py) that implements user input to produce a Voronoi Partition. While this program started as a school project, I developed the program outside of class during winter break. However, this program was very inefficient and would become very slow as the user added more points. 

Then, for my Algorithms final project, my group and I created detailed Delaunay and Voronoi patterns using Boyer-Watson algorithm in O(log n) runtime, a huge improvement from my first project. algorithm.py is the program my group created to demonstrate the relationship between delaunay triangulations and voronoi partitions. voronoiLeaf.py uses this algorithm to create a leaf pattern. Examples pictures are included, and more can be found at https://jadekandel.wixsite.com/jadesart/delaunay-and-voronoi-2020

Inspired by Voronoi patterns in nature, I proposed both these projects. Both these projects use Zelle graphics package and requires the graphics.py library.
